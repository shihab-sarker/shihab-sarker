Hello,

I am Shihab Sarker, currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Science with a major in Statistics at Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University. Over the course of my academic journey, I had actively contributed to more than 30 projects, research initiatives, surveys, and individual assignments. My responsibilities encompassed a wide spectrum of tasks, including data collection, organization, summarization, cleaning, error minimization, outliers detection, correlation and regression analysis, as well as the application of various statistical tests for data analysis.

Within my academic curriculum, I had gained comprehensive experience in core statistical theory and its practical applications. My expertise extends to statistical modeling, univariate and multivariate data analysis, correlation analysis, regression analysis, hypothesis testing, estimation, efficiency, core probability theory, probability and sampling distributions, sampling techniques, demography, and a diverse array of statistical tests.

Driven by a strong interest in research, I have acquired proficiency in statistical programming languages such as R, Python, and SQL. Over a period of more than two years, I have utilized these programming languages to perform tasks ranging from statistical modeling and data cleaning to in-depth data analysis. My ability to visualize insights from data showcases my adeptness in using these programming languages and tools to enhance the analytical process, contributing to a comprehensive and effective research approach.
